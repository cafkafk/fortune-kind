<Overfiend> but look at the French.  You could spell every word in
            their language phonetically using only about 6 letters
<Overfiend> 4 consonants and 2 vowels
<Overfiend> c, f, r, l.  And the vowels?  Well, one is the sound you
            make when you have constipation; the other when you have
            diarrhea
<Overfiend> what do you expect from that diet of snails and frogs?

I am amazed that no-one's based a commercial distribution on Debian
yet - it is by far the most solid UNIX-like OS I've ever installed,
and I've played with HP/UX, Solaris, FreeBSD, BSDi, and SCO (not to
mention OS/2, Novell, Win95/NT)

Whoever asked if the debian organization was dead isn't reading
debian-devel. 66 messages in one day, and it's not over. I find it
difficult to keep up.
